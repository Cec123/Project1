- Find 5 articles about secondary structure prediciton of proteins.
- Define characteristics of signalpeptides in eukaryotes,
alpha-helices, beta-sheets and turns, omega-loops.
- Read about SKlearn.

2018-02-20
-Parse my data.
-Read about input vector and machine learning on links from bioinfo.

2018-02-21
- Read more about SKlearn.
- Create a brief mindmap over the project (on paper).

2018-02-22
- Create a projectplan.
- Start writing on background for report.
- Find three more articles and submit the five articles.
- Create onehotencoder.

2018-02-23
- Hand in projectplan and references for the five articles.
- Attend at Journal Club.
- Attend at ElofssonÂ´s group meeting at scilife.
- Look into how I will create the windows for my sequences.

2018-02-26
- read through paper that I will present, again.
- Create a sliding window for my sequences.
- Convert my windows to codes of ones and zeros.

2018-02-27
- finished my x-vector, created my y-vector.
- trained my model using svm and translated my output of the model to a serie of S (signalpeptid) and M (mature protein).
- creating a powerpoint for my article. 

2018-02-28
- handled sequences consiting X, B and/or Z.
- Dividided my code into several functions.
- Practicing my presentation.
- Presented my article for classmates and giving feedback. 

2018-03-01
- fixed problem in my code when handling  with X, B, Z.
- not being able to run my whole file (problem with lines in the file I am handed?)
- created a parser for new input data, with no secondary structure.
- Writing feedbacks of yesterdays oral presentations.
- Trying to save my x-vector and y-vector in separate file in order to do the 
training and predicting in another file than the file with all my funcitons.

2018-03-02
-Journal club meetings.
- Trying to solve the problem with X, B, Z.

2018-03-05
- Changing my parser.
- Fixing with aminoacid U.
- Modifying my parser so that it only adds topology sequences and peptide sequences that are of the sam lenghts. 
- Modifying my code so that ut only collects the first 70 aminoacids (in order to make it less biased towards the mature protein sequence), this also reduced the inputdata.
- Correcting my datasets (manually) so that peptide sequences and topology sequences are on separate rows.
- Running 3-fold crossvalidation from windowsize of 3-32 in the steps of 4. 

2018-03-07
- changing my input handler, now it can take more than one protein sequence, predict its secondary structure and give an output with the secondary structure prediction and its corresponding protein name.
- Trying 5-fold cross validation
- Practice presentation for tomorrow.

2018-03-08
- Presentation day
- Trying new windowsizes, found that 65 is were it seems to peek.
- Training with wz 65.
- Fixing my predictor so that you can type your file in. 
- Fixing my datasets (balancing biggerdata2.txt and adding squences to input to predictor).

2018-03-09
- Tried random forest.
- Saved 3- and 5-fold cross validation with corresponding windowsizes.
- tried to change my parameters in the svm, but did not suceeed :( 

2018-03-12
- did GridSearch and found best parameters when using svm
- changed my predictor into 4 state instead of 2
- looked into how to create confusion matrix and started trying to make one
- tried to plot accuracy against windowsizes 5-39, as material for the report.
- Made a mindmap over the contents of my report 

2018-03-13
- created function for and calculated q3 
- created data for psiblast, bashscript for doing psiblast on dataset (did not succeed)
- Creating a graph viewing correlation of accuracy of model and different windowsizes
- Report writing

2018-03-14
- creating psst:s
- creating pssm model
-predicting new pssm input using the new model
- calculating Q3 for the new input
- starting writing explanations for my scripts and files in README.md

2018-03-15
- creating confusion matrix and computing mcc for all my three models.
- Correcting the Q3 calculations
- Writing the README, everything is now explained there, I just need to read it through for grammars and stuff.

2018-03-16
-Journal club, meetings
-Fixing with accuracies, windowsizess for pssm-model and random forest model, README and report writing (not finished)
